            <h2> COMPARISION OF NAVIGATION BAR OF OUR WEBSITE AND DARAZ :</h2>
            <p> The navigation bar is something that provide links for the information related to that particular
                website. Daraz is the online shopping website and it even comes as applications in mobile phone. It
                is quiet popular in nepal and it is Nepalsese website. Well lets get to the point and talk about the
                comparision of navigation bar between our website and deraz.
            </p>

            <h3>Similarites</h3>
            <p>Similarities are that whenever we touch the link given in the navigation bar it gets highlighted. Another similarity is that position of the navigation bar is at the top some website put their navigation bar at the bottom of the left side for example we have google they have kept its navigation bar at the bottom. Perhaps I don't think that we have any other similarities cause any more similarities may lead to copyright.</p>

            <h3>Dissimilarities</h3>
            <p>
                Now let's talk about the dissimilarities: The first dissimilarity is that Daraz has provided the language changer for the website in English and Nepali and we haven't provided the language changer. The links provided in the navigation are different. The colors used for the navigation bar are also different. Daraz has also provided the offer rate(discount%) in their navigation bar whereas we provided the offer rate(discount%) on the product page.

            <h2>COMPARISION OF PRODUCT PAGE OF OUR WEBSITE AND EASTERNLEAF:</h2>
            <p>
                The product page means where we keep the information or selling price of products. As I don't have much information about the origin of this website. This website is about plants, it sells almost all types of plants, gardening tools, and elements like soil and meds for the plants are also been founded. While our website is only focused on the bonsai plant. Now let's talk about the similarities and dissimilarities.
            </p>

            <h3>Similarities</h3>
            <p>
                The first similarity is that just like us even they are giving discounts on our product. Another similarity is they even have bonsai plants in their products. otherwise, no similarities left.
            </p>

            <h3>Dissimilarities</h3>
            <p>
                Now let's talk about the dissimilarities we have; Unlike our product page they have different kinds of plants in their products as our products are only bonsai plants and the website is also related to bonsai. They have described every product, While we have given a brief description for only one product, and for the other products we have only given the price and offer rate(discount price). They have given only a 10% discount for only some products, while we have given a 15% discount for all the products available.

                The similarities we have, just like every footer the format is the same as the logo and additional links about the website which is almost usual in any other website too.
            </p>

            <h3>Dissimilarities</h3>

            </a>
            <h2>COMPARISION OF BLOG PAGE OF OUR WEBSITE AND BONSAI EMPIRE :</h2>
            <p>
                A blog page is used for the website information, opinion, and content of the website for the website visitor. unlike us, bonsai empire doesn't sell products on their website while our website is commercial for bonsai. This website provides only information about the bonsai plant while our website sells the products.
            </p>

            <h3>Similarites</h3>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h2>COMPARISION OF CONTACT FORM OF OUR WEBSITE AND DROPBOX:</h2>
            <p>
                Contact form is available on almost all websites so the visitor can ask their queries or any other information and rate the website. Here we are going to tell you a little bit about dropbox. well, it helps us to store and share documents and data it has been also used for business purposes. Now let's talk about the similarities and dissimilarities.
            </p>

            <h3>Similarities</h3>
            <p>
                Their common similarity is that just like any other website it asks for a few details about the customer.
            </p>

            <h3>Dissimilarities</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing is that unlike dropbox we only ask for the person's name, email address, and gender or any message for us. While dropbox goes for many information like companies, countries, and even phone numbers. our contact form has even given the rating point option, while they haven't given it. The little bit more lengthy format than us to ask any queries.
